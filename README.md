# comparing_nmf_and_kmeans
We implement nmf and kmeans (as unsupervised classification algorithms) of four diffrent datasets and we compare these two algorithms.

We can see that in total we have better and faster results in nmf. 

Eplanation on how to make datasets are in the ONMF article that exists in the repo.
